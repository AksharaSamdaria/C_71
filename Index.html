                            Mrs. Seema gave shape to ‘techno curriculum’ that has a unique frame work which would evolve an analytical mind in the child. The hall mark of the path-breaking curriculum was the concept of ‘self- learning through practical interactive sessions’ in the class-room. The advantage is that a student would gain from the new method of learning that was to comprehend, discern and apply a concept – all at the same time.
